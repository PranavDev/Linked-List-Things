## Using the Data Structure: Linked List
> We use a class named LinkedList for Node declaration and definition.
> Using this class we generate nodes to hold data and a next pointer.
> Head Node is the first created Node to start the List chain.
> p and q pointer Nodes are used to jump up and down the Linked Lists.
