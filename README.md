# LinkedList-Python-
Singly Linked List Using Python

# Using the Data Structure: Linked List (Singly)
> We use a class named LinkedList for Node declaration and definition.
> Using this class we generate nodes to hold data and a next pointer.
> Head Node is the first created Node to start the List chain.
> p and q pointer Nodes are used to jump up the Linked List.

# I have used the following functions on the Linked List:
a. Append Data
b. Add data at a given Pos
c. Delete Data Node
d. Display the Linked List
e. Exit

# ENJOY
